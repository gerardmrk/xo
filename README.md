Helping out a friend setup something non-trivial

## TODOS

- [ ] Complete configurations for private source maps.
- [ ] Add option to simplify source maps during hot-reloading since it's slowing the reload process.
- [ ] Get to the bottom of dynamic translation files generation.

## Reminders

- Nullify global vars in renderer when process exits with any non-zero status so we won't have to worry about leaks down the road.
